It *should* be usable as of commit '168441d31c'. However, as there's no working gralloc module for Android on the Raspberry Pi, there's no real way of knowing if it is. If you happen to discover any issue with the libs, post an issue and it'll be looked into, or better yet, fork me and fix it yourself, then gimme a pull request.\r\n\r\nUse buildme.android to build. It requires cmake to be installed and an arm cross compiler. \r\nBefore running buildme.android, set the environment variables ANDROID_ROOT to your root-Android-dir, and ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN to your toolchain's /bin dir.\r\n\r\nContact: #razdroid @ irc.freenode.net -- My nick is Warg.","name":"Userland","google":"","tagline":"Source code for ARM side libraries for interfacing to Raspberry Pi GPU.
